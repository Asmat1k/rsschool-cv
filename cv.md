## About me
I'm currently a second year student at BSTU "Voenmeh", St. Petersburg. I'm studying at the faculty of Software Engineering. My goal is to become an experienced and in-demand programmer. I'm fond of programming and study new things in this field almost all my free time from studying at the university.

## Skills
- HTML
- CSS (SCSS, BEM)
- JavaScript (Fundamentals, ES6+, DOM)
- C, C++, C# (Study at university)

## Code
Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in biological systems. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T'). Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U'). Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.
```
function DNAtoRNA(dna) {
    let name = dna;
    while(name.indexOf('T')!=-1) {
            name = name.replace('T','U');
    }
    return name;    
}
```
