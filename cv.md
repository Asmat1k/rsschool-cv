## About me:
I’m currently a second year student at BSTU “Voenmeh”, St. Petersburg. I’m studying at the faculty of Software Engineering. My goal is to become an experienced and in-demand programmer. I’m fond of programming and study new things in this field almost all my free time from studying at the university.
